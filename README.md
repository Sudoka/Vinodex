Running the server
------------------

  You should run the server in a virtualenv. This can be done like so:
    `pip install virtualenv`
    `virtualenv venv`

  Then, you should install the requirements for the project:
    `pip install -R requirements.txt`

  Finally, you can run the server like so:
    `cd wine`
    `python manage.py runserver`
